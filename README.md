In this proposed system, we are going to investigate the use of Sensors and Machine Learning algorithm for air quality prediction in locality. With the growing industrialization, the problem are raised due to the pollution, air pollution is becoming major concern for the health., which are innovative system named “AIR QUALITY PREDICTION “ using IoT through various components and machine learning algorithm. 

The system makes use of the different parameters like Sulphur di-oxide, Carbon di-oxide, particular suspended material. Currently the Air Pollution is affecting the peoples and also our ozone layer because the amount of pollutant is not monitored properly.
